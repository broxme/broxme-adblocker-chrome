BroxMe Adblocker for Chrome
</h1>

BroxMe Adblocker is a free extension that blocks ads and malicious domains known to spread malware, disables tracking. We have included a few extensive filters that offer decent protection against annoying, flashy ads, YouTube commercials, and more. Unlike other adblockers we do not have a whitelist for websites, advertisers or ad networks to show you unwanted ads. Blocking ads will speed up your website load speed, decrease CPU and memory usage.

The extension allows you to switch back on ads for your favorite websites in case you know there are no intrusive and/or misleading advertising there.

## Features

* Remove all ads
* Block malware and tracking
* Improve browser performance
* No "acceptable" ads or whitelisted websites/ad networks

## Who are we?

We are a copuple of friends, software engineers, working on this adblocker and other security products in our spare time.

## Why another AdBlocker though?

BroxMe Adblocker was created with the sole purpose to block ALL ads. Many adblockers are affiliated with ad networks bypassing ads for a fee. We couldn't find an adblocker blocking everything, so we just decided to make our own, filtering every ad without exceptions. That is how AdBlocker Ultimate was born.
